This is a very basic React-Native app made without using the api. 
I have used a dummy database and the app cancels, Books and shows the status of shifts.
Can use Expo Go for the checking of output.
execution-
npm start
click s for expo go
scan the qr code on expo go app 
and the app is on your phone.
I have a very basic knowledge of knowledge of react-native but I will learn with help of hands on sessions.
I am confident that i can do this task.
Thank you for the opportunity.
